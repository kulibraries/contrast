### Discussions

**Data Carpentry Genomics Workshop**

Registration for this workshop opened 12/01; announcements in various venues are rolling out. Feel free to pass along the [registration link](https://kulibraries.github.io/2024-01-09-ku-dc/). We will be using Carpentries AMIs for the workshop with R/Rstudio on a Nautilus image as backup for the R portions.

**Other Projects**

Joel is planning to pilot his small R (r?) workshop with willing undergraduates after finals, with a goal of getting feedback and identifying additional content to cut out. Discussed feedback mechanisms and areas:

- timing
- exercises
- points of confusion
- having an observer for taking notes and timing each section
- having a way to collect anonymous plus/delta feedback after each section

**2024 Workshops**

With only three people present, we did not try to commit to any specific workshops for next semester. Brian is interested in the [HPC Carpentry](https://www.hpc-carpentry.org/) lessons; these could be relevant for teaching intermediate/advanced workshops on reproducible analysis workflows in HPC environments. 

Using HPC resources at KU for teaching is challenging; may be possible to use a cluster at Wichita State that's dedicated for teaching. Brian will inquire at a K-INBRE meeting; Jamene can check with KanREN if needed.

**Instructor Training and Checkout Tasks**

Folks are waiting for Q1 2024 workshops to be released.

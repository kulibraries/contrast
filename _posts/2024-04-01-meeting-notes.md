### Discussions

**Future workshops**

We tend to avoid scheduling workshops during semester breaks and theh summer. There is interest in offering Python this fall; Katie and Brian are comfortable enough with it to teach it. Perhaps we can find other instructors to teach the shell and Git lessons and offer a full Software Carpentry workshop.

Jess is interested in any work on a time series workshop.

**Debrief Data Carpentry Geospatial Workshop**

None of the Geospatial instructors were able to attend. Jamene ran through a few takeaways:

- Software installation for this workshop is very challenging on a Mac.
- The lesson material is a bit out of date, calling for an R package that has been deprecated by CRAN and linking to some stale software install options.
- Attendance was okay compared to registration. Some folks who were newer to R managed to stick with the whole workshop, which was awesome.

**Project Updates**

Brian is interested in a future Biohackathon, perhaps as a summer project. The event would collect ideas that would benefit from some coding efforts and put out a call for participation to help with the coding. Suggestions included movies (*War Games*, *Hackers*, *Gattaca*) and a possibility of using space in KU Libraries. The Libraries' [Sprints call for proposal](https://lib.ku.edu/sprints) might be a useful model for further planning.

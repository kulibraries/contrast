### Discussions

**Debrief Data Carpentry Genomics Workshop**

The workshop went well, considering the weather and technology issues in a hybrid classroom setup. Pacing was good, and learner feedback was very positive. Glad we didn't try to add the RNASeq content since it's a whole day on its own. There were very few issues with learners' command line programs or OneDrive locations, despite what we had expected.

The major issue during the workshop was how long it took (at least 30 minutes) for learners to download `fastq` files onto their AWS instances. The file structure on the AWS image contains a hidden directory with the `fastq` files already downloaded; recommend we use this next time after showing learners how the download would work.

KU Libraries' Communications Team did a news piece and video about the workshop: [https://lib.ku.edu/2024-genomics-workshop](https://lib.ku.edu/2024-genomics-workshop).

**2024 Workshops**

The AIMS sponsored project is planning a workshop series for Spring 2024. Topics and dates are:

- R Ecology (Data Carpentry Data Analysis & Visualization in R): February 26-27
- Geospatial + R (Data Carpentry): March 25-26
- Git (Software Carpentry): April TBD

The workshops are being led by AIMS postdocs and other project affiliates from all three AIMS regions: Great Plains, Mountain West, and Southeast. Target audiences include learners from Alabama A&M University and Haskell Indian Nations University.

**Instructor Training and Checkout Tasks**

February 1-2 instructor training had good vibes and good use of breakout rooms. No questions about checkout tasks.

**Other Projects**

AIMS postdocs have been in touch with The Carpentries about lesson development training; they are proposing a lesson on time series data manipulation, visualization, and dealing with this data in R. The next available set of workshops for lesson development training will occur in Fall 2024.

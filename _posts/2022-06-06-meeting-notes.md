### Discussions

**Q&A for instructor checkout**

Does this meeting count for the Carpentries Discussion checkout task?

No, it doesn't, but the monthly [Midwest Carpentries Community Call](https://pad.carpentries.org/local-us-midwest) does! Other [Carpentries Community Discussions](https://pad.carpentries.org/community-discussions) also count. In either case, sign up for a session on the Etherpad and include that you are attending for instructor checkout.

**Carpentries Lesson Development pilot workshop**

Jamene, Terry, and Rob have gotten into a pilot workshop teaching collaborative lesson development using the Carpentries pedagogical model and new lesson template, called the Carpentries Workbench. Our lesson topic is data visualization basics. The workshop schedule starts with four half-days of learning followed by a month-long break to teach the new lesson, then reconvening for two half-days of follow-up. We hope to use this experience as a foundation for writing an EPSCoR workshop grant.

**Data Carpentry Ecology Fall 2022 planning**

Briefly discussed some options, including:

- Using the same deconstructed approach as Software Carpentry in Fall 2021. DC-E covers a lot of topics and this would be one way to make it approachable.
- Some instructors have heard interest in learning both Python and R, so could be good to offer lessons on both languages as part of this workshop.
- Pairing instructors with different levels of experience is a positive; something we tried out during Software Carpentry Fall 2021 events. This practice is also present at KU in Petroleum Engineering and Environmental Studies, and is promoted by CTE.

With many folks absent for summer fieldwork, most of this planning discussion was tabled.

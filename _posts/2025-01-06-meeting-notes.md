**Workshop planning**

January 2025: Genomics

Registration is full at 25; workshop will be in-person only in Watson Library. No plans to schedule a tech check for the room. Caroline and Boryana will divvy up the lesson material. We are still waiting on AWS test instances from The Carpentries; Jamene will send these to instructors and helpers when they are available. Most helpers are planning to be available all day.

February 2025: Intro R

Brian, Jess, and Michelle are co-instructing and prefer in-person, although all acknowledge that an online workshop might be more feasible for learners. Discussed possible schedules that would cause the least conflicts with classes and department seminars. More offline discussion to come; seems likely we will select two half days during the second or last week of February. Jamene will look for available classrooms in Watson during these weeks.

Time Series Data developing lesson

Michelle and co-instructor are planning a test run of the first three episodes with a group of U. Alabama postbaccs. Time and date TBD.

**Other topics**

Rob will try to host a workshop at CU during the next year and will be in touch for planning tips.

For Genomics and every other workshop, don't forget to show learners how to log off and/or close a session. This one is easy to forget, but important!

Making mistakes is normal and expected, and are often small things like quote marks or typos. Learners can see that they're not making huge mistakes, and that it's still okay. It's often an opportunity to show an error that people will see in the future that may not be documented elsewhere. Suggestion to copy/paste regular errors and the fix into a sticky note app.

Always have a backup when teaching with an online service!

### Discussions

**Data Carpentry Genomics**

Workshop will be 3 full days, February 15-17 (Zoom), with Elizabeth and Boryana instructing. There are some open helper slots on Wednesday (2/16) and Thursday (2/17) mornings. Registration includes significant participation from CMRI. Both instructors are okay with increasing the registration cap to accommodate waitlisted learners. Elizabeth has generated a dataset for use in part of the workshop; both instructors are figuring out AMI logistics with using this dataset. Casey gets all the gold stars for providing some early AMI instances for Elizabeth and Boryana.

**Other Spring 2022 workshops**

1. OCR/Bash Shell unofficial workshop in late April (Kaylen & Jamene)
2. intermediate/Advanced R with RMarkdown and possibly the RStudio GitHub integration. Firm topics are still in development. Target for late Spring semester (Sam T. and Sam Z.)
3. Intro to Git/GitHub if #2 has a Git/GitHub prerequisite; would need to be mid- to late-March to still fit in R before May (People TBD)
   - Learners tend to sign up for the Git lesson hoping for GitHub, but 3 hours isn't long enough to cover all of the material.
   - Idea to start with GitHub, then move to CLI in an all-day format. Kaylen has had some success introducing Git to novices by starting with GitHub.
4. Data Carpentry Ecology - Spreadsheet lesson, data organization (tidy data) principles, timeframe TBD (tentatively Rob and Chris)

**Open Discussion**

Introductions to welcome Chris!

Q: What are the requirements after completing certification?

A: Teach at an official workshop within 1 year, then every 2 years after that to maintain certification. No need to teach a whole workshop on your own; we typically partner 2-3 instructors on one workshop. We had success in Fall 2021 pairing 1 new and 1 experienced instructor on each single-topic SWC workshop.

The Carpentries mines our workshop pages for instructor and helper credit after a workshop; Jamene updates the information if they don't catch everyone. Any instructor can log in to their [Carpentries database](https://amy.carpentries.org/account/login/?next=/dashboard/) (AMY) account to verify their data. Guidance for AMY is included in [The Carpentries Handbook](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/for_instructors/current_instructors.html#accessing-and-updating-your-instructor-profile).

**Q&A for instructor checkout**

- Can lesson contribution include Incubator lessons?
  - Yes, Incubator lessons are included
  - [Instructor Training Checkout Guidelines](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/checkout/index.html#eligible-repositories) include a list of repositories eligible for contribution
- In GitHub, look for issue tags like “good first issue” or “good for checkout”
- Contribution doesn’t have to be very big
- For R teaching demo, have your dataframe loaded in advance
- Making a mistake isn’t a big deal – walk them through what happened and then move on
- Make a separate profile for teaching so your software installation doesn’t include any of your usual customizations
- Consider choosing a shorter lesson so you don’t have to prep as many modules
  - Unlikely you would be asked to demo a lesson introduction or wrap-up; one of the skills you're being asked to demonstrate is teaching while live coding, so the episode you're given needs to have that content
- Have fun with it!
- Observing and commenting on other peoples’ teaching is part of the fun

**Group updates**

- Jamene will be on sabbatical January-June 2023; anyone interested in helping coordinate the group should reach out
- Rob has talked with HERS about interest in another Carpentries-style Data in Spreadsheets workshop where interns can bring their own data
- Thane's thesis defense is this Friday, 7/15; Zoom link and time are in the shared document for anyone who wants to attend and support him

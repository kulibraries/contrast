### Carpentries Instructorsâ€™ meeting
- Monday, October 7, 2024
- 9:00-10:00 AM

### Present:  
Brooks-Kieffer, Busch, Hanson, Kisielinski, Wilhelm

### Announcements
None

### Agenda

- Finding dates for Fall 2024 and early 2025 workshops

### Discussions

**Fall 2024 possible workshops**

Open Data Science with R: Katie, Jess, possibly Michelle. Brian had also expressed interest. Jamene will connect the possible instructors later in October.

Python: Meg previously expressed interest; Katie can be available.

**Spring 2024 possible workshops**

Genomics: Caroline is available in January; Jamene will reach out to Boryana. If we don't want to offer three full days, we can leave R for a later workshop. It's not necessary for all of this workshop's instructors to have a Genomics background - the Unix shell, intro to RStudio, and creating charts in R don't require Genomics knowledge.

**Other topics**

Michelle will be attending collaborative lesson development training to co-develop a time-series data lesson. Jess is interested in helping or offering feedback. The developing lesson will need to be test taught at least once during the training; this can be as formal or informal as the instructors want.

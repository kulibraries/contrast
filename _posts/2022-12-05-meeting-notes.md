### Discussions

**Data Carpentry Genomics: Planning update**

- Agreed dates: Jan 10, 11, 12 
- Registration 30?; waitlist cap 5; 
- Suggest announcement by Dec 9 (this Friday!) 
- 30 seems too high for registration 
  - JBK gave background on this cap; helped with Fall 2022 attendance numbers, but Genomics attendees are usually more motivated to attend. Tami will discuss with Elizabeth. 
- Same 3 day format as previous Genomics. 
- Caroline has email drafted for who is teaching what module; will follow up with Boryana 
- Amanda K. can help with this workshop if needed 

**Data Carpentry Ecology: SQL 2 (10/21) debrief**

Plus:

- Went smoothly
- Feedback from learners suggested the workshop went well
- Breakout rooms were used effectively
- Live coding and moving through the challenges helped move through material more quickly without leaving people behind
- Got through most of the lesson material

Delta:

- Data import caused some confusion. It would be helpful to go through this material more deliberately
- Most of the lesson material was covered except some at the very end
- Give yourself time to prep the lesson material (be kind to yourself)
- About half of people registered showed up. Registration was capped at 30.


**Planning/Brainstorming Spring Workshops**

- Paul – thoughts on SQL; will need to step back from Carpentries group for a few months; struggling to find the place in his current job where he uses it. Will be working on this this spring, but needs a few months to transition. 
  - Interested in teaching SQL later 
  - Question about visualization lesson in Incubator; interested to learn more about lessons in the Incubator. If interest in injecting more about certain tools in the intro data viz, e.g.: PowerBI, please let him know. 
  - For Kaylen – interest in presenting about DH to English faculty at Peru State? Interest in hearing more. Kaylen has contacts at UNL and could be interested in talking more. 
- Casey – no strong preference on what topic the workshop is; any workshop with a Bash Shell component he will offer to teach 
- Kaylen – enjoyed Python with Boryana; a KU group was very interested in the workshop but couldn’t register. Her primary commitment is to Humanities folks; wants to find a way to make sure these folks can get in to a workshop. Send out the link ahead of time to a specific group to give priority access. We could also do a workshop that is specifically for a group of people. 
- General – workshops can be small and focused to fit a specific need, especially if there is an instructor that is excited about teaching something or knows of a need. Talk to Elizabeth and Tami if you have an idea.  

**Q&A and support for instructor training and checkout tasks**

Katie – finished the training workshop, has finished discussion checkout task; scheduled for teaching demo later this month; lesson contribution still outstanding; wants to complete everything by the end of the year. 


**Monthly meeting day/time**

Votes for keep this day/time since it’s working. 
January 3rd meeting: will plan to meet on this day, last minute check in on the genomics workshop 

**General Discussion**

- One person workshop – Rob Ramos.  at Haskell. Workshop on graphical data science in R, used Ecology lesson. https://rpubs.com/jeremyyew/manipulate-pkg 
- Casey – two weeks at SC (SuperComputing) conference; recommend attending at some point – industry, education, research, national laboratories. Live computing demos on the exhibition floor. Scholarships are available (or have been). Next year is in Denver, CO.

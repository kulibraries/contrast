### Discussions

**2025 Meeting Schedule**

The group opted to keep the same meeting schedule into the new year. Jamene will send new appointments.

**Workshop planning**

January 2025: Genomics

Caroline and Boryana are instructing; in-person in Watson Library; two days only. Jamene will reserve the room and start planning tasks and registration.

February 2025: Intro R

Brian and Jess as instructors, possibly with Michelle. Brian will start an email thread for dates, division of instruction, etc. Considering [SWC R for Reproducible Scientific Analysis](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/) as the placeholder lesson for now. Registration doesn't need to open until January.

Time Series Data developing lesson

Possibly a trial run in January; the instructor group can help support this if needed. The second round of lesson development workshops hasn't been announced yet.

**Other topics**

April talked about an instructor training community call. Taylor is looking at instructor training in February 2025. Many folks on the call had advice for the teaching demo:

- Don't try to do too much. Explain everything you're doing. The 5 minutes goes by fast.
- Everyone is friendly and most are doing a teaching demo for the first time.
- Practice the demo during instructor training, and then do the same thing for the actual teaching demo.
- Even people with teaching experience get a lot out of the training. Typically no teaching training in grad school and the teaching practiced by The Carpentries is very active and hands-on - different from lecture.
- Talking and typing takes practice but there's no pressure to not make typos. Learners appreciate that it's okay to make typos. It's a good way to demonstrate troubleshooting. Narrate what typo you made and how you fix it.
- Teaching troubleshooting when something goes wrong is a really important skill for learners to see because they'll have to do it themselves outside of the workshop.

### Discussions

**Initial planning for Fall workshops**

May R workshop went well and had plenty of helpers. This lesson's presentation of pipes was good; would like to incorporate this approach into other R lessons.

Tentative interest in SQL for Fall. Suggestion from May R workshop to put R SQL content with a SQL workshop rather than R. This would presuppose some programming skill and R interest among the learners. Also the ability to use SQL within Python; this could split the learners.

Workshop at Haskell very likely for Fall but topic TBD.

Interest among AIMS affiliates for AIMS-specific workshops on Git, GitHub, bioinformatics pipelines. Unclear whether Data Carpentry Genomics covers the bioinformatics content that AIMS folks want. Idea to keep workshops to AIMS-only learners, but likely to need helpers with experience in workshop topics.

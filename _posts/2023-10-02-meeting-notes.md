**Fall 2023 Workshops**

Discussions included:

- Hope to have updates soon on bare bones R workshop that was discussed in September.
- Still working on planning some small single-topic shell and Git workshops in Anschutz.
- Probably will be another workshop at Haskell this fall; students will be polled to see what topic(s) they'd like. Others in the group can pitch in as needed.
- Interest in SQLfor social sciences, but don't know how much market there is for this topic. Jamene can reach out for some possible partners.
- Other discussion of needs of undergrads being onboarded in labs; Unix shell could be another needed topic.

**Beyond Fall 2023**

Interest in another Genomics workshop in Spring 2024; February works better for some folks. Jamene can touch base offline with others who might be interested in working on this event.

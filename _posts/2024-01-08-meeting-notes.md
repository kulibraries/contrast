### Discussions

**2024 Workshops**

The AIMS sponsored project is planning a workshop series for February. Potential topics include:

- R Ecology (Data Carpentry Data Analysis & Visualization in R)
- Reproducible Research with R (Incubator)
- Geospatial + R (Data Carpentry)
- Git (Software Carpentry)

Others are interested in SQL. Spring 2024 seems too soon to work on HPC Carpentry.

**Data Carpentry Genomics Workshop**

Weather was the main topic of conversation, especially since registrants include some non-local learners. Tentative plans to take the first workshop day to Zoom for safety.

Potential trouble spots in the lessons:

- Moving files from the AMI to the learner's local computer with `scp`
- Learner's desktops on OneDrive (Windows users)
- Data wrangling and processing section on QA with `fastqc` (Day 2); recommendation for helpers to go through that section
- Downloading IGV locally - would likely save this for the end of a day as a supplemental section
- Suggestion for learners to open a shell or terminal right away for troubleshooting
  - primary concern is Windows cmd syntax vs Unix-style syntax on Linux and Mac machines
  - becomes less of an issue once everyone is logged in to their AMI

**Other Projects**

Paul posted a link for folks to [volunteer](https://prepkc.org) to be a data science expert for high school students in the KC area.

Joel ran a pilot of his small R workshop based on R Ecology with 6 participants. Wasn't able to finish the lesson (no surprise) and is still looking for areas to trim. Got a lot of feedback about the whole lesson; `dplyr` seemed too abstract for the time available.

**Instructor Training and Checkout Tasks**

Two attendees are registered for training in early February.

Advice on teaching demo checkout task:

- Don't be nervous (although it's normal to be); it will be fine
- Don't rush through the content and the five minutes will fly by
- Look at the lessons they suggest and be comfortable with those; this is the best preparation

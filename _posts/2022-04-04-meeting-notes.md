### Carpentries Instructors’ meeting
- Monday, April 4, 2022
- 9:00-10:00 AM

### Present:
Albin, Brooks-Kieffer, Dwyer, Kisielinski, Koseva, Loecke, Nibbelink, Ramos, Russell, Thomas, Trana, Wheeler

### Announcements

One of our potential professional development topics is a demo/practice doing a GitHub pull request. At a recent [Midwest Carpentries Community Call](https://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/local-us-midwest ) one of the hosts demonstrated this process using a contribution to a Carpentries lesson as the frame. The session was recorded and is available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpEWDg8AbPc). This recording might be helpful for instructors looking to complete the lesson contribution checkout task.

### Agenda
- Welcome for new instructors, with Q&A
- Preparations for [Open Science Workflow with RStudio workshop](https://kulibraries.github.io/2022-04-27-ku-open-sci-online/)
- Further planning for spring/summer/fall workshops

### Discussions

**Welcome and Q&A**

Instructor training and checkout questions and comments:

- Is there a central list of Carpentries lessons? Looking for a RegEx lesson and didn’t see it; it’s something a lot of folks use every day
  - There’s a RegEx portion in the [Library Carpentry introductory lesson](https://librarycarpentry.org/lc-data-intro/)
  - Links to canonical lesson pages plus Incubator below:
    - SWC: [https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/)
    - DC: [https://datacarpentry.org/lessons/](https://datacarpentry.org/lessons/)
    - LC: [https://librarycarpentry.org/lessons/](https://librarycarpentry.org/lessons/)
    - Incubator: [https://carpentries.org/community-lessons/](https://carpentries.org/community-lessons/)

Instructor training recap:

- Day 1: lots of notes as a student, learning about pedagogy
- Day 2: practicing live coding and making a welcoming learning environment
- Point is to bring you out in instructor training; you’re not expected to be perfect or 110% prepared
- Preparation for lessons is valuable, AND nothing ever goes according to plan – this is a main takeaway of instructor training
- Troubleshooting is a useful skill in workshops – this can be more valuable than the content of the workshop – teaching people to google their error messages is a really powerful lesson
- A helpful environment to do well and figure out what you can do better next time
- Cross-platform is always a challenge; having an install get-together can be helpful; having helpers with different OS expertise is helpful, having some knowledge of multiple OSs can also help

Checkout task check-in:
 - Be sure to include your GitHub username in instructor training registration, since it’s tied to checkout tasks
 - If it’s something you need to fix later, can email instructor.training@carpentries.org

**Open Science Workflow with RStudio Workshop**

This will be a half-day workshop on Wednesday, April 27 (12-4pm) over Zoom, no deposit, capped at 25. Based on a [Carpentries Incubator lesson](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/open-science-with-r/). Focus is practicing a typical open science workflow that includes pulling in a live data stream, R code, writing reports with Markdown/RMarkdown, and version controlling the whole thing with Git/GitHub.

Approach and Contents:

- Everything taking place in RStudio
- Introduction to Markdown and GitHub
- Pulling in data from USGS
- Making a mock report with RMarkdown
- Intentionally messing it up to show the power of version control
- Publish the report on GitHub
- Hoping to get a demo of `dygraphs` from one of the instructors

Helpers needed, with skills in troubleshooting, RStudio, Git/GitHub, making a GitHub account, decoding R error messages. Two folks volunteered during the meeting - thanks!

Is the report output to PDF or HTML? HTML only, not planning to support LaTeX installation.

**Other Spring/Summer/Fall 2022 Workshops**

Folks are excited by the elements of Data Carpentry Ecology:

- Chris excited for Intro R for Ecology
- Rob brought up the Spreadsheets lesson; will be teaching a data viz / data wrangling course at Haskell in the fall; could also teach OpenRefine (Samantha also tentatively interested in OR)
  - These two lessons work together to show the utility of spreadsheets combined with data cleaning in a different program
  - Installation problems slowed down OpenRefine in DC-SS (March 2021)
    - Future workshops will benefit from dedicated installation help with OR
    - Requires Java or a comparable OpenJDK program (e.g. Amazon Corretto)
    - Admin rights can trip up folks without admin access to their computers
  - Modified spreadsheet lesson delivered for HERS (Haskell Environmental Research Studies) interns (July 2021); instructor had concerns about intensity
  - Lots of folks are excited about SQL
- Spacing once per week would be good since the lessons build on one another
  - A vote for Fridays
  - End of semester due dates conflict with workshops
  - Summer fieldwork also conflicts
  - Maybe early August, as with Data Carpentry Geospatial (August 2021) – a sweet spot between end of fieldwork and beginning of semester
- Format?
  - Online or hybrid have the most interest
  - Largely a decision for the instructors and helpers
- More to come

**Instructor Training**

Joel is now a certified instructor! Yay!

**Fall 2023 Workshops**

Discussions included:

- In person workshops?
  - Perhaps Anschutz Instruction Center would be a good location
  - It is underutilized, but has a kind of weird layout
  - Small - 20 max
- Discussed pitfalls of hybrid workshops; unlikely to embrace these right now
- Emphasis was on single topic workshops
  - Tami and Jamene will discuss offering Shell and Git
  - Josh interested in trimming down R to bare bones minimum in approx. 2 hours
    - has to teach this every semester to undergraduates joining the lab
    - undergrads aren't able to commit to one or two full days, but will get mentoring throughout the semester
    - sees beginners' most common problems are loading data, data object type, and data frame size/shape
      - possiblity to bring LEGO in to model some of these concepts
    - small audience; possibility of collaborating with another lab or Rob's class at Haskell
    - Will fork DC-E-R and start cutting; perhaps check in with Rob for feedback
    - Jamene standing by to do workshop logistics as needed

**Beyond Fall 2023**

Summer REU programs often look for intro R workshops for these students but don't start planning early enough, or instructors aren't available. Best to start planning in Spring at the latest for June workshops that would provide the most impact. Ideally these would be in-person since REU students are on campus. Possible that Joel's compressed R workshop would work for these students. Each discipline has its own REU, so coordinating would involve multiple contacts across campus.

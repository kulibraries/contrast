### Discussions

**Python workshop**

Workshop attendance capped at 25; seats filled quickly. Seems there's a lot of appetite for Python on campus. We'll be using Nautilus for Python access; Saron has confirmed that the Python image is up to date; he will be available for the workshop day.

Scheduled a tech check for Tuesday morning before the workshop. Confirmed that learner contacts are going out. The workshop website is at [https://kulibraries.github.io/2024-08-14-ku-py/](https://kulibraries.github.io/2024-08-14-ku-py/).

**Fall workshop plans**

Meg interested in another Python workshop later this fall. Katie is flexible and can do either Pythor or R again. Also interest in another Genomics workshop in early Spring 2025; can contact previously-involved instructors to see if they're available.

**Other topics**

Brian taught RNASeq recently, with a lot of interest from his department, and found that it's too complicated for a short workshop. Feedback was mixed since some of the material pre-supposed R knowledge. Still wants to formalize the material into a Carpentries format and offer it again. Could this be a future topic for [Lesson Development Training](https://carpentries.github.io/lesson-development-training/)?

### Discussions

**Future workshops**

Katie and Brian are interested in Python in August or September; depending on instructor availability, we could add Shell and Git for a full Software Carpentry workshop. Decision-making to come, including online or in-person format.

Jess will review the [Open Science with R](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/open-science-with-r/) and [Markdown](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/markdown-intro/). RMarkdown is being encouraged for open science.

In the farther future, Rob is interested in the Docker lesson if we ever get to teach it.

**Carpentries assessment**

Discussed a Carpentries assessment project, including the idea of reports for instructors. These could be helpful for instructors who have to report time and effort for programs and evaluations.

**Summer hiatus**

Discussed taking a meeting break for the summer months.

**Other topics**

Patience did a mini-series of 4-5 R workshops starting in March; has gotten good feedback from faculty wanting a basic introduction to R. Katie and Rob have been in training experiences recently that reinforced the value of Carpentries instructor training.
